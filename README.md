# Listo

WIP

Probably an API oriented service to build things faster.

Listo consumes other APIs to automate steps and deploy things inside any infrastructure.

```
glide install
go build
./listo
```

## Demo

One click deploying Ghost inside a Docker container provided by Bitnami behind Traefik proxy on AWS
